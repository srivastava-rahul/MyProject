<div class="message">
  <p>I'm terribly sorry, but I can't find the page you have requested.</p>
  <p>Believe me, I looked for it. Really! You can't even imagine the 
  millions of calculations I had to go thru to look in all the places
  the application could have left what you asked for. But I couldn't find it. It's not there! :-(</p>
  <p>May be you should go here and start again? <a href="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/">Click Here</a></p>
